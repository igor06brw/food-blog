# Hasselback Butternut Squash  

## info  
* About  minutes  
* 8 servings, as part of a meal  

## ingredients
* 1 large butternut squash (about 3 lbs)  
* 1 tbsp olive oil  
* 6–8 dried bay leaves  
* Kosher salt  
* Ground black pepper  

For glaze:  
* 1/4 cup maple syrup  
* 3 tbsp unsalted butter  
* 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar  

## steps  
1. Place rack in upper-third of oven and preheat to 425ºF  
2. Cut squash in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds  
3. Peel skin and white flesh below (should reach deep orange flesh)  
4. Rub all over with oil, season with salt and pepper  
5. Roast in baking dish until squash begins to soften (a knife should slip in easily to about 1/4"), about 15–18 minutes  
6. Meanwhile, put glaze ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until thick enough to coat spoon, about 6–8 minutes  
7. Reduce heat to very low and keep warm  
8. Transfer squash to cutting board and let cool slightly  
9. Score rounded sides of squash crosswise, going as deep as possible without cutting all the way through  
10. Return to baking dish, scored sides up, and tuck bay leaves between the slices  
11. Season with salt and pepper  
12. Roast, basting with glaze every 10 minutes; lift off any glaze in the dish that is browning too much  
13. Cook until tender and glaze forms a rich, brown coating, about 45–60 minutes  

## notes  
* Squash can be roasted up to four hours ahead, let cool and store at room temp; reheat before serving
