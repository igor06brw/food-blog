# Diner-Style Pancakes

## info  
* About 45 minutes  
* 2 mega servings (or 4 as part of a larger meal)  

## ingredients
* 2 cups all-purpose flour  
* 3 tbsp sugar  
* 1.25 tsp baking powder  
* 1.25 tsp baking soda  
* 1.25 tsp kosher salt  
* 2 large eggs  
* 1.75 cups buttermilk (see note)  
* 1/2 cup cold seltzer water  
* 1 tsp vanilla extract  
* 3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted  

## steps  
1. Whisk together dry ingredients  
2. In a small pot, melt the butter over low heat  
3. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the wet ingredients and butter, then add dry ingredients and stir until everything comes together (some lumps are ok)  
4. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, lightly grease, and cook 1/2-cup batter at a time, about 2.5 minutes per side  
5. Keep warm in low oven until ready to serve  

## notes  
* If no buttermilk on hand, can use the same amount of milk or 1.5 cups yogurt and 1/2 cup water (may need to adjust with a little water until the right consistency)
