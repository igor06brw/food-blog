# Bonchon-style Sauce

## ingredients
* 1/4 cup gochujang (see note)  
* 1/2 tsp cornstarch
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 3 tbsp dark brown sugar
* 3 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tbsp)
* 1 tsp grated ginger  
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil

## steps  
1. Combine everything in a small pot, stir well to combine  
2. Heat over low flame until bubbling  
3. Turn off and let cool, adding water as needed (sauce should be just thin enough to drop off a spool when inverted)

## notes    
* Gochujang is readily available in good Asian markets, but you can sub 2 tbsp Korean chili flakes (or red pepper flakes, in a pinch) with 1 tbsp soy sauce
