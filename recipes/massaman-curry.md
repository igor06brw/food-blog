# Massaman Curry  

## ingredients
* Optional: 1.5 lbs beef chuck, cut into 2" cubes  
* 2.5 cup coconut milk  
* 4–6 tsp curry paste (see below)  
* 2–3 tbsp fish sauce  
* 3 tbsp palm sugar, chopped  
* 2–3 tbsp tamarind juice  
* 2 medium potatoes (or 1 if using beef)  
* 1/2 large onion, sliced  
* 1/4 roasted peanuts  
* Optional: green chilies, slit (for extra heat)  

for the curry paste:  
(need about 4–6 tbsp total for this recipe)  
* 50 grams store-bought red curry paste  
* 1 tsp toasted coriander seeds  
* 1 tsp toasted cumin seeds  
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon  
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves  
* 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg  
* 2 whole cardamom pods  

## steps
1. Toast spices, grind, and add to store-bought red curry paste  
2. Prep tamarind juice, if using a block of tamarind  
3. If using beef: in a large skillet, add oil and sear the beef until well-browned; remove from pan and deglaze with water (keep liquid with beef for later)  
4. Over medium heat, add 1/2 cup coconut milk and bring to a boil  
5. Turn heat to low and add curry paste, stirring often until very thick or oil separates from the paste (may not happen if you use canned coconut milk)  
6. Add remaining coconut milk, meat and pan juices, 2 tbsp fish sauce, palm sugar, and tamarind  
7. Cook for about 20 minutes, until beef is fully cooked and a fork goes through easily (or flavors are well-combined)  
8. Add potato, onions, and peanuts; simmer for 15–20 minutes until potatoes are done  
9. Add more fish sauce and tamarind if needed  

## notes:  
* Chicken works really well in this recipe too, just cut into cubes and cook like the beef
* Add other vegetables like pumpkin, butternut squash, or carrots if not making with meat
