# QUESO DIP

## info  
* About 15 minutes  
* Enough for two mega-nacho plates  

## ingredients
* 1/2 small onion, finely chopped  
* 1/4 cup pickled jalapeños  
* 1 large garlic clove, crushed  
* 1 cup American cheese, grated  
* 1 cup asadero, Monterey Jack, or other cheese (see note), grated  
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter  
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt  
* 1.5 tsp juice from pickled jalapeños  
* 1 tsp ground cumi  
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper  
* 1 cup milk  
* 1/5 tsp cornstarch  

## steps  
1. Chop the onion and pickled jalepeños  
2. Grate the cheese (should be about 8 ounces or 2 cups total)  
3. Heat the butter in a saucepan over medium heat until foamy (about 1 minute)  
4. Reduce heat to medium-low and add onions, then crush garlic into pot and season with salt  
5. Cook until onions are tender but not browned, about three minutes  
6. Add cumin and cayenne pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until aromatic  
7. Stir in most of the milk (leave some in the measuring cup for later) and bring to a bare simmer  
8. While the milk is cooking, add the cornstarch to the milk and whisk with a fork until smooth  
9. When the milk is simmering, add the cornstarch mixture and bring up the heat to medium  
10. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture has thickened and coats the back of a rubber spatula (see note)  
11. Reduce to medium-low and add American cheese, stirring until fully melted but not bubbling, about three minutes  
12. Add other cheese a handful at a time, stirring until fully incorporated before adding the next handful  
13. When all cheese is added, remove from heat and add pickling liquid and half the jalapeños  
14. Serve immediately and garnish with remaining jalapeños  

## notes  
* Instead of Monterey Jack, Texans suggest asadero cheese. Can use cheddar, though the sauce may break it will still taste great  
* However, don't buy pre-shredded cheese! It comes with anti-clumping agents on it, which prevents the cheese from melting into a smooth sauce  
* Worked fine for me with oat milk instead of cow's milk  
* Recipe notes that queso may be stringy when adding the cheese – this is ok but don't want it to bubble at all  
* Other recipes listed below suggest addding pobalano chiles and fresh jalapeños, and topping with chopped chives
