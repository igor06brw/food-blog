# Creamy Chicken Enchiladas

## info  
* About 2 hours  
* 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 3 poblano peppers  
* 1 large onion, quartered  
* 1.5 lbs tomatillos  
* 1–2 serrano peppers  
* 3 cloves garlic, unpeeled  
* 2 cups stock  
* 1 cup cilantro leaves  
* 2 lbs bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs  
* 1 tbsp oil  
* 16 corn tortillas, preferably homemade  
* 8 oz shredded pepper jack cheese (see note)  
* 1 cup crema, divided (see note)  

## steps  
1. Turn on the broiler to high and set rack about 8" below  
2. In a foil-lined baking sheet, place poblanos, onion, tomatillos, serranos, and garlic and broil, turning occasionally, until tomatillos are lightly charred, about 10 minutes (see note)  
3. Remove tomatillos and continue cooking until poblanos are charred on all sides, about 2 minutes; remove poblanos to a separate bowl and cover    
4. Continue cooking until remaining vegetables are softened and charred, about 5 minutes; remove to bowl with tomatillos  
5. Move rack to middle position and set oven to 375º F  
6. Add stock to bowl with poblanos and peel while submerged; transfer peeled peppers to bowl with tomatillos  
7. Strain stock though a fine mesh strainer into bowl with vegetables to remove seeds and skin  
8. Add cilantro and set aside  
9. Season chicken on all sides with salt and pepper  
10. In a large pot, add oil and heat over high heat until shimmering  
11. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook undisturbed until well-browned, about 6 minutes  
12. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the other side, about 2 minutes  
13. Transfer chicken to a bowl, keeping any juices in the pot  
14. Add vegetables to pot and scrape any browned bits from the bottom  
15. Puree with an immersion blender until a chunky sauce forms, season to taste with salt and pepper  
16. Return chicken to pot, bring to a simmer, cover with lid slightly ajar, and cook until chicken is done, about 15 minutes  
17. When chicken is done, remove from heat and transfer to a large bowl; let rest until cook enough to handle  
18. Shred chicken, discarding bones and skin  
19. Add 1 cup sauce, half the cheese and half the crema; toss to combine  
20. Lightly grease a 13x9" pan, then spread about 1/3 of the sauce on the bottom  
21. Optional: dip each tortilla in the sauce and stack on a cutting board  
22. Place about 2 tbsp filling in a line along each tortilla and roll tightly, the place seam-side down in pan  
23. Spread remaining sauce on top, then sprinkle with cheese  
24. Cover with foil and bake for about 15 minutes  
25. Remove foil and bake until cheese is browned, about 10 minutes  
26. Drizzle with crema and serve  

## notes  
* Jack cheese can be replaced with Oaxaca or other cheese too  
* 1 cup crema is a **lot**, can def reduce to about 1/2 cup total  
* If in a hurry, can also dry-roast the veggies in a cast iron pan (and poblanos directly on the burner)
