# Thin-Crust (and Quick) Pizza

## info  
* About 90 minutes  
* Enough for two people to pig out  

## ingredients
* 630g bread flour  
* 15g sugar  
* 10g kosher salt  
* 10g instant yeast  
* 32g olive oil (about 3 tbsp)  
* 420g lukewarm water  

## steps  
1. Add dry ingredients to food processor, pulse to combine  
2. Add olive oil and water and run for about 90 seconds  
3. Transfer to lightly-oiled surface, knead until smooth ball is formed  
4. Divide in half and let sit, covered, for about 45 minutes  
5. Preheat oven to 500ºF, top pizzas, and cook until done  

## notes  
* Could also let sit for 24–72 hours in the fridge, then let come to room temp for 2 hours before cooking, but this works great as a last-minute pizza dough  
* See the King Arthur Flour recipe below for another approach
