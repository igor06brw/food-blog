## ingredients
* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces

* 1/2 tsp ground white pepper  
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder

For the breading:  
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

* 1/2 tsp baking powder  
* 1/2 tsp ground white pepper  
* 3/4 cup water  
* 4 cups neutral oil for frying

## steps  
1. In a mixing bowl, mix chicken and salt until combined; cover and refridgerate for at least 45 minutes (2 hours max)  
2. Lightly grease a baking sheet  
3. Transfer chicken to food processor, add spices and run until a smooth, uniform paste forms (about 1 minute), scraping down the sides if necessary  
4. Roll into balls and flatten between palms until about 1/2" thick; place on baking sheet  

Bread the nuggets:  
1. In a large bowl, mix the dry ingredients  
2. One at a time, coat nuggets in flour, pressing gently to adhere then shake off excess and return to baking sheet  
3. Let sit for 15 minutes; reserve flour mix  

Fry:  
1. Heat oil over medium-high heat until 350ºF  
2. Set wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet  
3. Add 3/4-cup water to flour and wisk until smooth  
4. Add half the nuggets to the batter and toss gently until submerged  
5. Remove half of the nuggests from batter and let excess drip into bowl, then add to oil  
6. Cook, flipping every 30 seconds, until they puff and start to brown, about 4–5 minutes  
7. Remove to wire rack and cook the remaining nuggets  
8. Let rest for five minutes on rack  
9. Bring oil to 375ºF  
10. Return all nuggets to oil and cook, flipping, until deep golden brown and very crispy, about 4 minutes
